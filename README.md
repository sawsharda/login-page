# Login Page

This is a basic login page frontend.

## To run Locally
 
 To run the project locally, do the following:
 
 ```bash
git clone https://github.com/sawsharda/login-page.git
cd login-page
npm install
npm run dev
 ```

## Current Bugs:
- The signup feature is working but the login page doesn't remember the user credentials and hence can't login again after logout.
